1. Thread safety
MemoryCache is thread safe, but RequestAccessToken method for Authentication class is not.
But this is only the problem when concurrent requests for the same userId are made, 
while locking it could block access to the method itself.
Taking into consideration that generating access token is really quick and requesting token for the same userId is unlikely,
I decided not to lock the method.

2. Global object
Using HttpContext.Current.Application["Authentication"] in web project is not the most elegant solution.
In production system global object could be passed to controllers using IoC container.
